# AI Scheduling Assistant with LangChain & Svelte

## Description  
This project demonstrates an AI-powered scheduling assistant built with **LangChain** in **TypeScript**.  
Natural language inputs are processed and converted into structured **JSON**, which serves as the foundation for generating and managing schedules based on existing data.  
The solution shows how conversational interfaces can seamlessly integrate with structured planning logic.

A **showcase application** was developed with **Svelte**, where both the frontend and backend are implemented.  
The backend directly connects to **OpenAI**, ensuring that user requests are handled efficiently while keeping the scheduling pipeline flexible and extendable.  
By leveraging LangChainâ€™s modular framework, the project combines language understanding with structured output formatting to produce consistent and reliable results.

## Key Features
- ðŸ—“ Natural language input transformed into structured **JSON input/output**  
- âš¡ Automatic schedule generation from existing data  
- ðŸŽ¨ **Svelte showcase** with integrated frontend & backend  
- ðŸ§© **LangChain (TypeScript)** for reasoning and orchestration  
- ðŸ¤– **OpenAI integration** for powerful language understanding  
- ðŸ”§ Extendable design for real-world applications and AI-driven workflows  

## Purpose  
This repository provides a foundation for experimenting with AI-assisted scheduling and showcases how modern frontend frameworks, strong backend integrations, and advanced language models can work together effectively.
